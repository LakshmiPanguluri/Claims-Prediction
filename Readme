The dataset contains details about the age of the person and various disease conditions like alzheimers, arthritis, cancer,	copd,	
depression,	diabetes,	heart.failure,	ihd,	kidney,	osteoporosis,	stroke and reimbursed amounts for the year 2008 and 2009 if any. The 
buckets are created based on the amount disbursed as 
Reimbursment	Bucket
0-2999	       1
3000-7999	     2
8000-19999	   3
19000-54999	   4
>55000	       5
The goal is to predict the bucket of the patient for the year 2010. Only the age and reimbursement amount are continuous. All the disease 
variables are binary implying 1 is a diseased/diagnosed condition.
